# Algorithm: DQN

using custom OpenAI gym environment and Keras DQN agent

## Folders
<em>data</em> is for training/testing data

<em>env</em> is different kind of environments ever tried

<em>logs</em> is for TensorBoard to save results

<em>myrl</em> is for code files from Keras-rl and modified basically to apply new Dqn algorithm and save training results

## File name of xxxAgents.py

The main training process is in xxxAgent.py. 

* NewDqnAgent: agent with Q value modification algorithm
* DqnAgent: original Keras Dqn agent with some changes to save the training results 

File DqnAgent.py is with detailed annotationã€‚

Fistly, just have a look at file DqnAgent.py and /env/S4A11R5.py to understand the process. Training results are uploaded in Drive.
